todo-triumph
============

This app will make it just a little more fun to get things done, by offering a todo list that uses D3 visuals to provide some positive reinforcement.

I will build this app using test-driven development, with a mobile-first mindset.

### Technologies To Be Involved
- Node.js/Express: Backend
- Jade: Templating
- Zurb Foundation: Mobile-first Frontend
