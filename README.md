todo-triumph
============

This app will make it just a little more fun to get things done, by offering a todo list that uses D3 visuals to provide some positive reinforcement.

I will build this app using test-driven development, with a mobile-first mindset.

Note that I am *not* using Yeoman in this project, because I don't want to use Yo here -- in order to gain a proper understanding of Grunt and Bower, I want to set them up myself. I also don't want Yo's scaffolding to take care of things like integrating Passport and Foundation for me.

### Technologies To Be Involved
Bolded items are technologies that I am learning for the first time as part of this project.
- Node.js/Express: Backend
- **Jade: Templating**
- **Bower: Managing client-side packages**
- **Grunt: Taskrunner**
- **ZURB Foundation: Mobile-first frontend**
- **SCSS: Styling**
- **Intern: JavaScript testing**
- **JSHint: Confirming use of best practices**
- **AngularJS: Frontend**
- **MongoDB: Database for storing users**
- **Passport: Authentication**
- **D3.js: Visuals**
